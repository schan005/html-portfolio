<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Sarah, I work in an office in Japan. On top of my so-called 9-5, I
  love to make my own art, study web development and design, and also UX/ UI. My
  artwork focuses on paper cuts, stencils (pochoir), and print making. I
  sometimes also mess around with a bit of photography. I like to not only eat
  food, but cook and bake as well.
