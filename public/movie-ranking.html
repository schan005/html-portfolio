<h1>The Best Movies of All Time According to Sarah</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite movies of all time!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Edward Scissorhands</h3>
<p>
  A great movie that shows the juxtaposition of conformity of social norms and
  understanding those who don't follow convention. Be your unique self!<br />
  In addition to "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", this is the only other Johnny
  Depp movie that I can watch.
</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>
  A Ghibli animation with beautiful imagery and story telling that brings
  elements of Japanese history and culture to a modern set story.<br />
  Studio Ghibili animations are some of the best in the world, and the stories
  are able to interpret Japanese culture and history in very interesting ways.
</p>
<h3>Goodbye Lenin</h3>
<p>
  Beautiful storytelling of a part of post war Germany that intertwines a family
  and love story with political and historical changes in Germany.
